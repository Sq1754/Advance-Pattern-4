# Diamond or Rhombus Pattern

This Java program generates a diamond or rhombus pattern based on the user input of the number of rows.

## Description

The `Q11.java` program prompts the user to input the number of rows for the diamond or rhombus pattern. It then generates a pattern where each row contains a combination of spaces and asterisks (\*) to form a diamond or rhombus shape.

## Pattern Example

For example, if the user inputs 4 as the number of rows, the program will generate the following pattern:

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
*******
 *****
  ***
   *

```
